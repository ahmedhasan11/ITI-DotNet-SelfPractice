//if you dont need only the Employee_ID && Project_ID in the Relation Table M-M between Employee-Project
so you can let context make the Relation for you how???
1- In Employee class:we made ICollection of Project
2- In Project class: we made ICollection of Employees

//what if you need to add an attribute to the M-M Relation Table???
now you need to make a Class for that table by your hand
1- Works_For Class have navigation Property of Employee && Project
2- Employee class get nav ICollection<Works_for>
3- Project class get nav ICollection<Works_for>

//Last Note we will discuss

//we did a relation between department and employee : 1 Employee work in 1 dept
&& 1 dept can have many employees

//what if we need to make anothr relation between department and employees too
1- 1 Employee supervises 1 department
2- 1 department can have many supervisors

2-w gwa el department Collection mn Employee
3-kan 3arf en el FK elle gwa Employee by4awr 3la el Department

//f el mo4kla hna en enta dlw2ty gwa Employee enta m3ak 2 obj mn Department

//////////tyb hna el mo4kla en ezay el context hy3rf

dependent of el object elle esmo Dept (in Employee class)

2- ezay el collection bta3t supervisors(in Department class)
dependent of el object elle esmo SupervisedDept(in Employee class)
